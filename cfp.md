# Call for Papers

## 30th Annual Fall Workshop on Computational Geometry
### October 14-15, 2022

#### North Carolina State University

The 30th Annual Fall Workshop on Computational Geometry will be held at
North Carolina State University on October 14-15.
We welcome your submissions of abstracts.
The conference website is [http://go.ncsu.edu/fwcg2022](http://go.ncsu.edu/fwcg2022).
Submission info via easychair is included below.

## Scope and Format:
The aim of this workshop is to bring together students and researchers
from academia and industry, to stimulate collaboration on problems of
common interest arising in geometric computations.  Topics to be covered
include, but are not limited to:

- Algorithmic methods in geometry and topology
- Machine learning
- Topological data analysis
- Sensor networks and network technologies
- I/O-scalable geometric algorithms
- Animation of geometric algorithms
- Computer graphics
- Solid modeling
- Geographic information systems
- Computational metrology
- Graph drawing
- Experimental studies
- Folding and unfolding
- Geometric data structures
- Implementation issues
- Robustness in geometric computations
- Computer vision
- Robotics
- Computer-aided design
- Mesh generation
- Manufacturing applications of geometry
- Computational biology and geometric computations
- Computational conformal geometry

Following the tradition of the previous Fall Workshops on
Computational Geometry, the format of the workshop will be informal,
extending over 2 days, with several breaks scheduled for discussions.
The workshop is open to the public, with no registration fee.
There will be an Open Problem Session where participants are encouraged
to pose and present research questions.

## Submissions:
Authors are invited to submit abstracts (up to 4 pages) for contributed talks
to be given at the workshop. Submission is via easychair: [http://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=fwcg2022](http://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=fwcg2022).

We encourage submissions of full paper drafts (if available) along with the
abstract. Because there are no formal proceedings for the workshop,
submission of material that is to be submitted to (or to appear in) a
refereed conference (e.g., SODA'2023, SoCG'2023) is allowed and encouraged;
please indicate clearly with the submission if the work has already been
presented/accepted elsewhere.

Contributed talk abstracts, due by Friday, September 9, will be reviewed by
the program committee, with notification by Friday, September 16.

## Travel Support:

There is (limited) travel support for students and postdocs at US institutions to FWCG 2022.
All students and postdocs (at US institutions) are encouraged to apply, but
priority will be given to speakers who have no (or limited) other travel
funding. Since support is limited, we anticipate mostly funding of local
(shared) accommodations and relatively inexpensive travel. (Registration at
FWCG is free.)

To apply for travel support,

- visit and complete the form at this link (https://forms.gle/5sJANxZuUDN2Tus99).  You will
be asked to provide your name, email affiliation, student/postdoc status,
a brief statement, etc.

- if you are a student, your adviser must also send a separate email to Don
Sheehy (drsheehy@ncsu.edu) with subject "FWCG 2022 travel support"
confirming your student status, recommending your attendance at FWCG 2022,
and describing any other available travel funds. Vague statements such as
"funds are tight" are not informative. Each adviser may nominate at most
two students for travel support.

Applications and supporting letters should arrive by September 23 for full
consideration; late applications will only be considered based on
availability of funds. Awardees will be selected and notified by
September 30.  Applications will be reviewed in consultation with the FWCG
program committee.

The requested information will be used to prioritize awards according to the
following criteria:

- Speakers presenting at FWCG who do not have other travel support.
- Members of under-represented groups with research interests in
computational geometry, whose attendance would broaden participation at the
conference.
- Applicants whose statements and supporting information make a particularly
compelling case for attending the conference.

Travel awards can be used only to offset transportation and lodging costs;
other expenses such as food cannot be reimbursed. Receipts will be required
for all covered expenses. All reimbursements will be made after the workshop.


## History:
This series of Fall Workshops on Computational Geometry was originally
founded in 1991 under the sponsorship of the Mathematical Sciences
Institute (MSI) at Stony Brook, with funding from the U. S. Army
Research Office providing support during 1991-1995.  It continued
during 1996-1999 under the sponsorship of the Center for Geometric
Computing, a collaborative center of Brown, Duke, and Johns Hopkins
Universities, also funded by the U.S. Army Research Office.  The
workshop returned in 2000 to Stony Brook for its tenth year, and then
was hosted at Polytechnic University, Brooklyn, NY in 2001.  The
twelfth workshop (2002) was part of the Special Focus on Computational
Geometry and Applications at DIMACS, while the thirteenth (2003) was
part of the the Mathematical Foundation of Geometric Algorithms, as
part of the Special Semester on Computational Geometry at Mathematical
Sciences Research Institute, Berkeley.  The fourteenth through
twenty-ninth workshops were hosted at MIT (2004), the University of
Pennsylvania (2005), Smith College (2006), IBM T.J. Watson Research
Center (2007), Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (2008), Tufts
University (2009), CCNY (2011), Stony Brook University (2010),
University of Maryland (2012), CCNY (2013), University of Connecticut
(2014), University at Buffalo (2015), the CUNY Graduate Center (2016),
Stony Brook (2017), Queen's College CUNY (2018), and Montana State
University (2021).  In 2022, we are pleased to host the 30th Fall
Workshop on Computational Geometry at NC University.
