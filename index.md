# The Fall Workshop on Computational Geometry

#### October 14-15, 2022

#### North Carolina State University

The aim of this workshop is to bring together students and researchers from academia and industry, to stimulate collaboration on problems of common interest arising in geometric computations. Topics to be covered include, but are not limited to:

- Algorithmic methods in geometry and topology
- Machine learning
- Topological data analysis
- Sensor networks and network technologies
- I/O-scalable geometric algorithms
- Animation of geometric algorithms
- Computer graphics
- Solid modeling
- Geographic information systems
- Computational metrology
- Graph drawing
- Experimental studies
- Folding and unfolding
- Geometric data structures
- Implementation issues
- Robustness in geometric computations
- Computer vision
- Robotics
- Computer-aided design
- Mesh generation
- Manufacturing applications of geometry
- Computational biology and geometric computations
- Computational conformal geometry

Following the tradition of the previous Fall Workshops on Computational Geometry, the format of the workshop will be informal, extending over 2 days, with several breaks scheduled for discussions. The workshop is open to the public, with no registration fee. There will be an Open Problem Session where participants are encouraged to pose and present research questions.
