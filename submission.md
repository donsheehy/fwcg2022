# Submission Info

Authors are invited to submit abstracts (up to 4 pages) for contributed talks
to be given at the workshop. Submission is via easychair: [http://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=fwcg2022](http://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=fwcg2022).

We encourage submissions of full paper drafts (if available) along with the
abstract. Because there are no formal proceedings for the workshop,
submission of material that is to be submitted to (or to appear in) a
refereed conference (e.g., SODA'2023, SoCG'2023) is allowed and encouraged;
please indicate clearly with the submission if the work has already been
presented/accepted elsewhere.

Contributed talk abstracts, due by Friday, September 9, will be reviewed by
the program committee, with notification by Friday, September 16.
