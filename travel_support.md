# Travel Support


There is (limited) travel support for students and postdocs at US institutions to FWCG 2022.
All students and postdocs (at US institutions) are encouraged to apply, but
priority will be given to speakers who have no (or limited) other travel
funding. Since support is limited, we anticipate mostly funding of local
(shared) accommodations and relatively inexpensive travel. (Registration at
FWCG is free.)

To apply for travel support,

- visit and complete the form at this link (https://forms.gle/teXtcKpcwhRwa9Ua7
).  You will
  be asked to provide your name, email affiliation, student/postdoc status,
  a brief statement, etc.

- if you are a student, your adviser must also send a separate email to Don
  Sheehy (drsheehy@ncsu.edu) with subject "FWCG 2022 travel support"
  confirming your student status, recommending your attendance at FWCG 2022,
  and describing any other available travel funds. Vague statements such as
  "funds are tight" are not informative. Each adviser may nominate at most
  two students for travel support.

Applications and supporting letters should arrive by September 23 for full
consideration; late applications will only be considered based on
availability of funds. Awardees will be selected and notified by
September 30.  Applications will be reviewed in consultation with the FWCG
program committee.

The requested information will be used to prioritize awards according to the
following criteria:

- Speakers presenting at FWCG who do not have other travel support.
- Members of under-represented groups with research interests in
  computational geometry, whose attendance would broaden participation at the
  conference.
- Applicants whose statements and supporting information make a particularly
  compelling case for attending the conference.

Travel awards can be used only to offset transportation and lodging costs;
other expenses such as food cannot be reimbursed. Receipts will be required
for all covered expenses. All reimbursements will be made after the workshop.
